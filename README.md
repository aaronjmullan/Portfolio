This project is a basic portfolio that I created to upload my projects onto and to showcase my programming skills
The main aim for this project is to create a functional portfolio to upload my projects onto while using GitHub as a host

### Motivation / Reasoning for this project

The main reason for this project is that upon reading several posts saying to make a portfolio to showcase your work,
I figured I'd start one early especially while I have spare time. I looked around for the best place to use as a host, where I found GitHub Pages.
